✅ **Personalized** - Acknowledge what they actually said
✅ **Action-oriented** - Make it easy for them to take the next step

---

## Remember:

Each reply should feel **personal, professional, and purposeful**. You're not just pushing DMs - you're genuinely helping people while guiding them to the best place for detailed assistance. Keep it conversational but polished, brief but complete.`.trim();
